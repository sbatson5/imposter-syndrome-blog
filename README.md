### What's this all about?

This is my personal blog, built using gatsby.js and the Lumen theme.
I've diverted from the default theme a bit.
If you're curious about that, just look at the [previous pull requests](https://github.com/sbatson5/imposter-syndrome-blog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).

### Writing posts

This is mostly for my own reference since I often forget how to use the tools that I wrote *for myself*.
To generate a new post:

```bash
scripts/new-post "The Art of the Code Review"
```

This will add a new markdown file, titled with the current date and all appropriate metadata.
No need for constant copy and pasting!
