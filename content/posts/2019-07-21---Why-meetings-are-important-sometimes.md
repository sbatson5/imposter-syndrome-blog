For as long as I've been a developer, I've heard people complain about how useless meetings are.
There seems to be such an averse reaction to seeing a chunk of time on your calendar taken up by a vague meeting like "Talk about v2 rollout" or "Weekly tech sync."
I'll be the first to admit that not all meetings are necessary, or that some can just happen over email or slack.
But too many developers seem to paint with broad strokes that all meetings are bad or that somehow _they_ are above meetings.
This can be such a toxic attitude and you might find you end up wasting more time in the long run by avoiding meetings.

## The 10x Engineer

This blog post was inspired by this ridiculous twitter thread that has been going around:
