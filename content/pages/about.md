## Education

I originally received a Bachelor's in English from the University of Maine.
I got into development in the hopes that I could create a time machine, go back in time and set everything right...

I took night courses in web/software development from [Great Bay Community College](http://greatbay.edu/) and did a lot of self learning.
If you want advice on getting started in web development but don't think you can go back to school or do a bootcamp, shoot me an email!
